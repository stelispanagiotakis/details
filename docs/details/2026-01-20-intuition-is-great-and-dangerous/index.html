<p>Any kind of intuition of predisposition seemed <em>dangerous</em> as I had no way of knowing why I leaning that way (biases, misinformation etc)</p>
<p>This analytical process was lengthy and exhausting but I like to think it helped shape a way of thinking and form a (mostly) reliable intuition.<br>

I could now trust my gut and stop the (over)analysis, right?</p>
<p>Well, sort of. You see any kind of gut feeling gives answers for <strong>everything</strong>, but these answers are <strong>reliable</strong> only about the kind of questions for which it has been <strong>trained</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#example">#</a></h2>
<p><em>(Do NOT calculate, try to use your gut)</em></p>
<p>I am asked to <strong>tie a rope around the Earth</strong>&rsquo;s equator.<br>
I buy the needed <strong>~40.000km</strong> of rope and spend some time deploying it.<br>
But as I&rsquo;m finishing I find out that we now need this rope to not be tight around the Earth, but instead <strong>levitate 1 meter above it</strong>.<br>
I rush to the rope store to buy some more rope for this.</p>
<p><strong>Ballpark estimation, how much more rope do I need?</strong> <strong>1km? 50km? 10.000km?</strong><br>
Note the number down!</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s calculate.</p>
<p>Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere of radius <strong>r</strong> in meters, its circumference would be <strong>2πr</strong> meters.<br>
Now the rope needs to be 1m above, so the new radius is <strong>2π(r+1)</strong> meters.<br>
Which means I need to buy <strong>2π(r+1)</strong> - <strong>2πr</strong> =<strong>2π</strong> = <strong>6.3m</strong> meters of rope</p>
<p>Unless one&rsquo;s day job is tying rope around the globe, one&rsquo;s intuition would lean towards buying a few thousand kilometers of rope for the extension.<br>
You know, to be safe :-P<br>
And one would be off by a few thousand kilometers.</p>
