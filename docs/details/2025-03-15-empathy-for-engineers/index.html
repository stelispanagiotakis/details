  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been in a couple of leadership seminars. One of the concepts that arose as central for good leadership was empathy.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s empathy? Let&rsquo;s use <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/empathy/definition#:~:text=Emotion%20researchers%20generally%20define%20empathy,might%20be%20thinking%20or%20feeling">this</a> definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the ability to sense other people&rsquo;s emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone says <code>I'm sad</code> and I hear that, am I now empathetic towards them?<br>
Empathy is not superficial, but an in-depth understanding of both the state (<code>sad</code>) and its underlying causes, ideally coupled with the ability to predict future behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caveat: It&rsquo;s also a lot of work, takes a lot of time and it does not necessarily pay off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same seminars, I heard it voiced, that this is a difficult concept to explain to Engineers.<br>
(Ironically this difficulty would be easily overcome by having a bit more empathy for Engineers :-P )</p>
<p>Is there an equivalent that might help Engineers understand how to gain empathy?<br>
Not the concept itself, a tool to get there.</p>
<p>Suppose your app connects to a Postgres DB to store data.<br>
At some point you notice that data isn&rsquo;t stored anymore.<br>
You have the state. What do you do to understand the nature of the issue and why it happened?</p>
<p>You enable <strong>DEBUG</strong> logging.</p>
<p>It may have been a Postgres patch update that auto-installed and is causing issues.<br>
It might have been something in your app&rsquo;s latest release.<br>
Or a network issue.<br>
You have the underlying causes.</p>
<p>By enabling DEBUG logging you&rsquo;ve gotten a much deeper understanding of the causes, hopefully some idea about how to fix it and perhaps a few action items on how not to have this happen again. Also, same caveat as above applies here too. But if you spend the time&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got much greater <strong>empathy for Postgres</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Now go do it for people too.</strong></p>
