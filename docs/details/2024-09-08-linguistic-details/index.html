<p>I&rsquo;ve been collecting these little gems for years.<br>
While at some point these little details may prove useful (or not), I choose to appreciate them as they are.</p>
<h2 id="accurate-vs-precise">accurate vs precise<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#accurate-vs-precise">#</a></h2>
<p>An instrument is precise if you measure with it many times and the consecutive measurements only differ slightly.<br>
An instrument is accurate if you measure with it and the measurement is close to the real value.<br>
So while we frivolously use these two words interchangeably, an instrument can be precise without being accurate and accurate without being precise.</p>
<h2 id="venom-vs-poison">venom vs poison<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#venom-vs-poison">#</a></h2>
<p>I love this one because it comes with a punchline.<br>
If it bites you and you die, it&rsquo;s venomous.<br>
If you bite it and you die, it&rsquo;s poisonous</p>
<h2 id="safe-vs-secure">safe vs secure<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#safe-vs-secure">#</a></h2>
<p><em>safe</em> refers to not being in danger.<br>
<em>secure</em> refers to having been fortified to prevent some dangers.<br>
A house in a zero crime neighborhood is safe even with its doors open. It does not need to be secured and it thus, it may not be secure.<br>
A house in a high crime neighborhood may be as secure as money can buy and still not be safe.<br>
Then, why oh why, do we call the device in which we put our valuables to <em>secure</em> them a <em>safe</em>?<br>
My personal opinion? It&rsquo;s sales.<br>
As a customer you might ask about the specs of a safe to determine if it&rsquo;s good enough.<br>
But you only really care about feeling that your valuables are safe in it.<br>
And sales is all about that feeling of yours.<br>
So the device is marketed based not on its capabilities, but on the value it can bring you.<br>
The warm and fuzzy feeling of being (a) <em>safe</em>.</p>
<h2 id="transparency-vs-clarity">transparency vs clarity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transparency-vs-clarity">#</a></h2>
<p>In the context of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>transparency is having access to it</li>
<li>clarity is understanding it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a wise decision you need both, they are complementary (but perhaps not complimentary)</p>
<h2 id="supposedly-vs-supposably">supposedly vs supposably<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#supposedly-vs-supposably">#</a></h2>
<p>supposedly: It is supposed by someone. You&rsquo;re just relaying this supposition of theirs. We don&rsquo;t yet have a clue where you stand on the matter.<br>
supposably: You&rsquo;re saying that this opinion can be supposed. While not certain about it, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re leaning towards.</p>
<h2 id="validate-vs-verify">validate vs verify<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#validate-vs-verify">#</a></h2>
<p>verify: to ascertain and/or demonstrate if something is true or justified ( from latin word for truth <em>veritas</em>)<br>
validate: to ascertain and/or demonstrate if something is strong in some regard ( from latin word for strong <em>validus</em>)<br>
You can verify that a product meets its initial requirements<br>
But you then also need to validate with the user that it is useful to them.</p>
