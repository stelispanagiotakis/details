<p>So, if almost nobody cares, why bother?
Peace of mind.</p>
<p>Not in the <em>soothe one&rsquo;s OCD</em> sense.<br>
In the <em>understanding and managing risk</em> sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing in software engineering called <em>Agile Methodology</em> that we mistake to mean <em>I&rsquo;ll think ahead as little as humanly possible</em></p>
<p>It makes sense if you&rsquo;re managing a project that is short-term, one-off or will need constant supervision.<br>
There, details are not that important.<br>
Assuming you&rsquo;ve got capable and/or invested people at the helm, they&rsquo;ll react to any change caused by factors not identified in advance and course-correct.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re on a long-term, important project that you&rsquo;re hoping to see through with minimal manpower, you need to streamline/automate/set-it-and-forget-it.<br>
And you can&rsquo;t hope to automate something you do not understand in detail.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to delve into each and every little detail.<br>
You don&rsquo;t need to be able to write a paper on the subject.<br>
But you need as few unknown unknowns as you can possibly have.<br>
Having a deep enough to be meaningful, shallow enough to be time conscious and wide as possible understanding of the subject allows one to know where risk lies.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eliminate risk, it costs too much to do so.<br>
But you can identify it, classify it and plan to mitigate if/when the need arises.<br>
To do that, you need the details.</p>
