  <div class="post-content"><p><strong>Selfishness is usually frowned upon.</strong></p>
<p>Largely because it&rsquo;s taken to mean <code>looking after my own interests to the detriment of others</code>.<br>
I find this definition a bit too simplistic.</p>
<p>All relationships, all interactions contain a transaction.<br>
While it&rsquo;s not at all romantic to voice as much ( ask me how I know :-P ), there is something to gain in everything we do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a friendship because you get a sympathetic ear.</li>
<li>Saying hi to your neighbor so it&rsquo;s not awkward when you ask them for some coffee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the motive is evident and hurts others (so it&rsquo;s labeled selfish).<br>
Sometimes it&rsquo;s more subtle and it avoids detection by this crude filter.</p>
<p>My beef with this definition is not its crudeness though.<br>
It&rsquo;s that <strong>it assumes a zero-sum game.</strong><br>
If I win, you lose.<br>
Which is, again, simplistic and not necessarily true, especially if you are willing to put a bit of work into the matter.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong>Job interviews</strong>.<br>
One could argue that it&rsquo;s me vs them.<br>
They are trying to find reasons not to hire me, I am trying for the opposite.<br>
We have <strong>conflicting interests</strong>.<br>
Within this frame, all kinds of unsavory behaviors have room to fester.</p>
<p>How else could it be though?<br>
The way I&rsquo;ve been framing this lately is <code>mid-term alignment</code>.<br>
The worst outcome today is not that the company doesn&rsquo;t hire me.<br>
It&rsquo;s that they hire me and six months down the road, either one party or each party individually, realizes that it was a bad fit.<br>
Then I&rsquo;m starting to look for a new position and the company puts out a new job ad.<br>
This is a bad outcome for both.<br>
<strong>Six months down the road we have aligned interests</strong>, let&rsquo;s focus on that!<br>
Both parties are still looking out for their own self-interest, but now it&rsquo;s not needlessly adversarial.<br>
We can focus on determining mutual suitability.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is this how it&rsquo;s usually done? No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it require a level of trust that may not be there? Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can it be applied to all persons and situations? No. If I&rsquo;m desperate for a job I might not care for any kind of alignment, just a paycheck.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But it doesn&rsquo;t need to be always true to be valuable.</strong></p>
<p>If we remove the guilt from healthy selfishness and tentatively trust the other party, we can create the conditions for a much healthier experience and a likely better outcome.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not always a zero-sum game, or at least it doesn&rsquo;t need to be.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why <code>mid-term</code> alignment? If you focus on the <code>now</code> too much, you revert to the <code>unsavory behaviors</code> I was trying to avoid.
