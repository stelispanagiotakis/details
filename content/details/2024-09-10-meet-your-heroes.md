There's this quote that I hate

> _Never meet your heroes_

The assumption being that our heroes should be seated on pedestals and admired from afar.  
Meeting them will uncover their human flaws and thus they'll lose their glory and primary function.

That's why I love Colossus' quote from the first Deadpool movie

> _Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true. Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice - to make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend, spare an enemy. In these moments, everything else falls away._

I'm in the habit of collecting heroes.  
They're usually people I've interacted with that, flaws and all, exhibit certain qualities I want to emulate.  
They're models of behavior trained on hours spent with them.  

So, in those four or five moments, I'm pretty sure what my hero would do.  
Which makes my choice easy.  

I'm pretty happy with the results so far :-)
