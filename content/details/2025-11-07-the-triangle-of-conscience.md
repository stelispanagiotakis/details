Conscience is like a triangle in your heart.

When you do something wrong it spins and hurts you a bit.

If it spins for too long, its edges fade and it stops hurting.

( This metaphor is supposedly inspired by a Navajo teaching. I could not find reputable sources about the origin or the usage of the .metaphor. But the idea seems potent enough to stand on its own.)
