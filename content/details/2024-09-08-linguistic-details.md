Language is a terrific tool to get your message across.  
But it exactly that, a tool.  
Everyone uses it for their purposes.  
And if it succeeds we should be happy.  
After all, conveying a nuanced message is hard enough in itself.

_This is why I've stopped being pedantic about small errors in syntax or grammar, unless the sender has explicitly asked for comments on that._

On the other hand, it's almost magical when you notice a skilled speaker masterfully choosing the correct word to relay their message.  
In just as many words, they've communicated volumes more.  
But to understand and appreciate that you need to be prepared.

I've been collecting these little gems for years.  
While at some point these little details may prove useful (or not), I choose to appreciate them as they are.

## accurate vs precise

An instrument is precise if you measure with it many times and the consecutive measurements only differ slightly.  
An instrument is accurate if you measure with it and the measurement is close to the real value.  
So while we frivolously use these two words interchangeably, an instrument can be precise without being accurate and accurate without being precise.

## venom vs poison

I love this one because it comes with a punchline.  
If it bites you and you die, it's venomous.  
If you bite it and you die, it's poisonous

## safe vs secure

_safe_ refers to not being in danger.  
_secure_ refers to having been fortified to prevent some dangers.  
A house in a zero crime neighborhood is safe even with its doors open. It does not need to be secured and it thus, it may not be secure.  
A house in a high crime neighborhood may be as secure as money can buy and still not be safe.  
Then, why oh why, do we call the device in which we put our valuables to _secure_ them a _safe_?  
My personal opinion? It's sales.  
As a customer you might ask about the specs of a safe to determine if it's good enough.  
But you only really care about feeling that your valuables are safe in it.  
And sales is all about that feeling of yours.  
So the device is marketed based not on its capabilities, but on the value it can bring you.  
The warm and fuzzy feeling of being (a) _safe_.

## transparency vs clarity

In the context of information:  

- transparency is having access to it  
- clarity is understanding it.  

To make a wise decision you need both, they are complementary (but perhaps not complimentary)

## supposedly vs supposably

supposedly: It is supposed by someone. You're just relaying this supposition of theirs. We don't yet have a clue where you stand on the matter.  
supposably: You're saying that this opinion can be supposed. While not certain about it, that's where you're leaning towards.

## validate vs verify

verify: to ascertain and/or demonstrate if something is true or justified ( from latin word for truth _veritas_)  
validate: to ascertain and/or demonstrate if something is strong in some regard ( from latin word for strong _validus_)  
You can verify that a product meets its initial requirements  
But you then also need to validate with the user that it is useful to them.
