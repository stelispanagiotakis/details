title: "Intuition is great... and dangerous"

In my formative years, I would try to apply logic to any and all matters.

- How do I decide what to do?
- Why should I do this?
- What does this impact? etc etc.

Any kind of intuition of predisposition seemed _dangerous_ as I had no way of knowing why I leaning that way (biases, misinformation etc)

This analytical process was lengthy and exhausting but I like to think it helped shape a way of thinking and form a (mostly) reliable intuition.  
I can still remember the exhilarating feeling of hearing a question, leaning one way about it, then analyzing it and discovering I still liked my original inclination.  
I could now trust my gut and stop the (over)analysis, right?

Well, sort of. You see any kind of gut feeling gives answers for **everything**, but these answers are **reliable** only about the kind of questions for which it has been **trained**.

## Example

_(Do NOT calculate, try to use your gut)_

I am asked to **tie a rope around the Earth**'s equator.  
I buy the needed **~40.000km** of rope and spend some time deploying it.  
But as I'm finishing I find out that we now need this rope to not be tight around the Earth, but instead **levitate 1 meter above it**.  
I rush to the rope store to buy some more rope for this.

**Ballpark estimation, how much more rope do I need?** **1km? 50km? 10.000km?**  
Note the number down!

Now let's calculate.  
  
Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere of radius **r** in meters, its circumference would be **2πr** meters.  
Now the rope needs to be 1m above, so the new radius is **2π(r+1)** meters.  
Which means I need to buy **2π(r+1)** - **2πr** \=**2π** = **6.3m** meters of rope

Unless one's day job is tying rope around the globe, one's intuition would lean towards buying a few thousand kilometers of rope for the extension.  
You know, to be safe :-P  
And one would be off by a few thousand kilometers.

## So?
**Trust your gut, only as far as you have trained it, I guess? :-D**
